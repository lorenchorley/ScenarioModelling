# The tech used in this project

* I'm using ASP.Net Core 9 
* I'm using Blazor for the front end
* I'm using wsl2, docker, helm and minikube to test my deployment

# My approche and preferences

* I prefer a TDD approche where I write the tests first and then the code to make the tests pass.
* My tests are often highly data driven and make full use of DataTestMethods
* Tests should cover both positive and negative scenarios, including edge cases and invalid input.
* I prefer to use the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern for writing tests. This helps to keep the tests clean and easy to read.
* I prefer leaving an appropriate amount of spacing in my code so that it is readable
